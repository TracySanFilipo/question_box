#Question Box

Objective from next line:

"This assignment is meant to test your whole knowledge of Python and JavaScript
as tools to build web applications. In addition, it is a test of working in a
team, like you will be for the final project."

We used Django, Rest Framework, Postgre, JS/Jquery, and Handlebars to build
this app.

Question box is a slack style question and answer web app. Logged in users can
post and answer questions, while users without an account can only view
questions. Currently new question tags can be created, questions can be created
and viewed by date, and they can be answered from a popup modal next to each
question. There are several more features we plan to add in the future, such as
better communication with the user, user profile pages, user ratings, and
several other ways to organize the question list.
